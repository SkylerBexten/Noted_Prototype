	a. See if users will find the system useful.
	b. See if users can use show/hide dialog box.
	c. See if users can use code field.
2. High-level Reason
	a. Is the program actually useful for programming?

Test Objectives
1. Create new note
2. Rename note
3. Put note into "X" category
4. Import code into note
5. Split up code into code "chunks"
6. Open a calculator widget to solve math problems
7. Open a unit converter widget to convert English to metric units
8. Create new category
9. Rename category
10. Put category into "X" category

Scenarios
1. You have discovered a new species of bacteria on the ocean floor.  Create a new note to record its characteristics and put it into its rightful place in the "Tree of Life".  You'll have to create a new category to place it.
2. Import a DNA sequence into a spoiler in a species note. Maybe
3. You want to import some code into a note titled "myCode". However, the code needs to be reformatted. Import the file "code.py" into your note and break up the code by classes to make it more readable.
